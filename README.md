- Update 3/23/2022: 
    - In the "connection_SQL" file, you can find how to connect the database and transfer each table in dataframe.
    - In the "LinearRegression_populationPredict" file, I tried to predict population based on "market_pop_data" dataset using Linear Regression. Tried to find the highest predicted increased population state. I have to check and update it because the R2 is 99. So it could overfit the model probably due to small size of daaset.
