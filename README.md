- Update 3/23/2022: 
    - In the "connection_SQL" file, you can find how to connect the database and transfer each table in dataframe.
    - In the "LinearRegression_populationPredict" file, I tried to predict population based on "market_pop_data" dataset using Linear Regression. Tried to find the highest predicted increased population state. I have to check and update it because the R2 is 99. So it could overfit the model probably due to small size of daaset.
Update 3/28/2022:
 - In the "LinearRegression_populationPredict" file, the R2 testing (0.9999164)  is higher that R2 training(0.9999204) . Meaning our model is doing good predicting the 2022 population in each state.
